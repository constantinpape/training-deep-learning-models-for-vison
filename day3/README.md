# Day 3

## Content

- Advanced topics:
    - Image segmentation and denoising with U-Net (in detail)
    - Other applications: object detection (depth estimation, ...)
    - Intro to biomedical image analysis
    - More on loss functions

### Exercises:

* unet_pytorch - follow the notebook and solve all the tasks to run a unet on Kaggle nuclei dataset
* unet_Keras - the same for keras
* care_basic_tutorial - a basic image restoration (CARE) workflow for 2D denoising and upsampling as a single notebook
