# Day 2:

## Content

- Deep Learning for Vision:
    - Introduction to CNNs
    - Data augmentation

### Exercises:

For this webinar you will first have to go through the example notebooks describing all the parts of the training pipeline for [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). Afterwards you will have to go through the exercise notebook where you will be required to write your own (or modify the example) pipeline to train a network on the [CIFAR10 data](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). 

Please note that there are two versions of the same exercise implemented in two libraries: Keras (a wrapper around Tensorflow) and PyTorch. Both are widespread and have their advantages and disadvantages. You can read more about the difference [here](https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/). For this exercise we strongly recommend that you go through __both__ of them, since if you are planning to work with Deep Learning in the future, you might need to be able to understand the code both in TensorFlow and PyTorch.

To complete the exercise you would have to do the following:

* example_mnist_pytorch - go through the example of training various networks on MNIST dataset in Pytorch
* exercise_cifar_pytorch - complete the exercise for CIFAR10 dataset in Pytorch
