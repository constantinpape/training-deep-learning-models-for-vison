# Longer Exercises

On the last day, you should work on a larger exercise (without a notebook template) by yourself, building on the material we have covered in the course.
You are welcome to choose the topic of this exercise yourself and also work on data of your own choosing.
We have also prepared some ideas for longer exercises:

- [Solve a 3D segmentation problem on data from plant biology]()
- [Contrastive learning for visual representations]()
<!-- more exercises?
- []()
- [Use your phone to deploy a simple classification problem]()
-->

## Mounting your google drive in colab

For some of the exercises here, it is better to have some permanent storage for access to larger datasets or to save model checkpoints.
To get permanent storage in google colab, you can mount your google drive.
Check out the notebook [mount-gdrive-in-colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/exercises/mount-gdrive-in-colab.ipynb) for instructions.
