# Day 1

## Content

On the first day we will recap basic concepts of machine learning and computer vision.
In particular, the lectures ([you can find the slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PNoyDIemKKE7Eo02txJfY0kge7tqlrWB1EY9USK4OGY/edit?usp=sharing))
will cover:

- Machine Learning Basics
    - Supervised Learning
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Computer Vision Basics
    - Tasks: Image Classification, Object Detection and Segmentation
    - Computer vision with preset features and shallow learning
    - Preview of feature learning and CNNs
- Deep Learning Frameworks
    - Why do we need deep learning frameworks?
    - Overview of the popular frameworks
    - Introduction to pytorch

This course is based on a course taught at EMBL. You can find the webinars recorded for this course online:

## Exercises

The 3 exercises for this day will focus on Image Classification using supervised learning techniques on the [CIFAR10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

- 1_data_prepration: load cifar data and prepare it for training with pytorch. [available on colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/day1/1_data_preperation.ipynb)
- 2_logistic_regression: train single layer model on cifar10. [available on colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/day1/2_logistic_regression.ipynb)
- 3_multi_layer_perceptron: train multi layer model on cifar10. [available on colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/blob/master/day1/3_multi_layer_perceptron.ipynb)
