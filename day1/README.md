# Day 1:

## Content

- Introduction to Machine Lerning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision
    - Basics of Machine learning, focus on supervised learning
    - Basics of Neural Networks: MLPs and SGD

### Exercises:

 * Notebook 1 - image_manipulation. In this notebook we will work with the data from Kaggle Data Science Bowl competition. We will load the data, display the images and apply various transformations available in cv2 library. 
 * Notebook 2 - ReadingData. In this notebook, we first will read images and their corresponding labels and then will wrap and save them in a single file on disk (or google drive). It helps us a lot later to avoid reading so much data each time when we are working with our models. We will use the python pickle module to wrap images in a single file.
